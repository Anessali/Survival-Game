This is a text-based survival game that currently doesn't have a name. This is a rather ambitious project and the game is in pre-alpha, so there's not much to see yet, but read on for a rundown of what my goals are and what I've completed.

## Passage of Time - Complete
The passage of time is the very first thing I completed.

[*] Time passes
[*] Clock displays in-game time
[*] Day and night cycles
[*] Days of the week

*Note: Currently only a 24 hour clock is available and I don't have plans to add a 12-hour clock. I may add one later.

## Inventory System - Complete
As a survival game, I feel like the inventory system is kind of the backbone. Players need to be able to pick up items, whether it's to use a rock as a makeshift weapon or to eat some mushrooms they found. Every item in the game is being designed as an object with properties.
[x] Player can pick up and discard items
[x] Player can attempt to eat any item. Not everything is edible, though.
[x] Most items can be equipped as a weapon. A rock makes a decent weapon if you've got nothing else, but smacking stuff with a mushroom won't be very effective. The only items that can't be equipped as a weapon is armor.

## Needs Management
Players need to manage hunger, thirst, and fatigue. 
[x]Player becomes hungry, thirsty, and fatigued over time
[x]Player can eat, drink, and sleep to manage their needs.
[ ]Forage for food/water/items
[ ]Make camp

## Combat
I haven't gotten started on combat yet, but I do consider this a must before I'm willing to start calling the game a beta release. 
[ ] Get a basic combat system in place
[ ] Generate creatures(wolves, bears, monsters, etc) that the player can run into
[ ] Implement a wounds system - the player can die after combat from a serious wound.

## Weather, Seasons, and Hypothermia/Hyperthermia
This may or may not make it into the beta release, but I would like to add this in at some point. This would add a bit more depth to the survival mechanics beyond eating, sleeping, and drinking. 
[x] Items have a warmth rating
